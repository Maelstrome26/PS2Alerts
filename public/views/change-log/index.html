                    <b>Player Profiles</b> - I'm happy to present the first iteration of Player Profiles! With player profiles, you'll be able to see the statistics for any particular player we have on record, including stats such as:
                </p>
                <ul class="enable-bullets">
                    <li>
                        Kills, Deaths, Teamkills, Suicides and headshots across all alerts recorded
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Averages, such as K/D, Kills &amp; Deaths per alert etc
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A list of all alerts that a player has participated in
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All weapon kills, headshots and teamkills a player has accumulated
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All vehicle metrics - note, that this metric is a bit dodgy and may be removed

                    Leaderboards have been implemented on alert pages! You're now able to see what you ranked in each and every alert! There are currently 4 leaderboards: Players, Outfits, Weapons and Vehicles.

                <p>
                    Project status widgets have been added to the site, detailing the status of the current page you're looking on, keeping you up to date with the progress of the project as well as letting you know where to post suggestions.

                    The initial implementations of the <a href="alert-history">Alert History</a> and <a href="alert/19999">Alert Detail</a> pages have been launched! The Alert History page allows you to see all alerts in the past 48 hours (a temperary measure until a better date selection system can be made) and you're also able to see basic information and leaderboards on a per-alert basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new version of the website will also feature a complete redesign, as you can see by the very simple example that's shown below. I've learnt a lot about coding since I did PS2Alerts v4.0 back in October last year, so I think it's time to apply said knowledge.
