                    I'm happy to announce the new Leaderboard system! While in it's initial version, you'll be able to see the top 100 players, outfits and weapons by various metrics. See who are the top farmers, teamkillers, suiciders and crops, by all servers or by single servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This version is the start of something quite big in PS2. The website will soon&trade; have competitive ladders, which will pit you against other players of your server, and globally, and give you a ranking. More on this soon.

                    Alert Leaderboards have been implemented on alert pages! You're now able to see what you ranked in each and every alert! There are currently 4 leaderboards: Players, Outfits, Weapons and Vehicles.

                    Project status widgets have been added to the site, detailing the status of the current page you're looking on, keeping you up to date with the progress of the project as well as letting you know where to post suggestions.

                    The initial implementations of the <a href="alert-history">Alert History</a> and <a href="alert/19999">Alert Detail</a> pages have been launched! The Alert History page allows you to see all alerts in the past 48 hours (a temperary measure until a better date selection system can be made) and you're also able to see basic information and leaderboards on a per-alert basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new version of the website will also feature a complete redesign, as you can see by the very simple example that's shown below. I've learnt a lot about coding since I did PS2Alerts v4.0 back in October last year, so I think it's time to apply said knowledge.
