                        Combat Statistics Update
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Having been absent from the website for quite some time now (and was on previous versions), I've added the Combat Statistics section, available on the <a href="/" class="ga-event" ga-campaign="Change Log" ga-action="Homepage - Combat">home page</a> under <i class="fa fa-fighter-jet"></i> COMBAT.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section shows the overall combat statistics (kills, deaths etc) and displays not only the total but the faction distribution. This way you're able to see exactly how many kills a VS Heavy Assault got in an alert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The section also shows the comparisons across classes, e.g. Heavy Assault kills vs Infiltrator kills.
                    </p>

                        Alert Real Time Update!
                    </h3>
                    <p class="center-align">
                        After a year long hiatus - and unfortunately being unemployed :-/ - I've taken some time to develop my flagship website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interested in knowing who's at the top of the leaderboard at any given moment in an alert? Now you'll know!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To that effect, I've now completed the real time mechanics on the alert pages. That means, every kill, death, map capture etc will be reflected on the result page in real time whenever an alert is in progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've also taken the opportunity to fix various bugs, layout issues etc and giving the website general polish. If you have any suggestions or bug reports, let me know on the <a href="https://github.com/Maelstromeous/PS2Alerts/issues">GitHub page!</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've also updated the project page, reflecting the project's current progress and what I plan to work on.

                    <p>
                        <b>Faction Victory Contributions</b> - Shows a breakdown of the total number of wins, per faction, and how they contribute to the overall faction percentages.

                        I'm happy to announce the new Leaderboard system! While in it's initial version, you'll be able to see the top 100 players, outfits and weapons by various metrics. See who are the top farmers, teamkillers, suiciders and crops, by all servers or by single servers.

                        This version is the start of something quite big in PS2. The website will soon&trade; have competitive ladders, which will pit you against other players of your server, and globally, and give you a ranking. More on this soon.

                    <p>
                        Alert Leaderboards have been implemented on alert pages! You're now able to see what you ranked in each and every alert! There are currently 4 leaderboards: Players, Outfits, Weapons and Vehicles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Project status widgets have been added to the site, detailing the status of the current page you're looking on, keeping you up to date with the progress of the project as well as letting you know where to post suggestions.

                        The initial implementations of the <a href="alert-history">Alert History</a> and <a href="alert/19999">Alert Detail</a> pages have been launched! The Alert History page allows you to see all alerts in the past 48 hours (a temperary measure until a better date selection system can be made) and you're also able to see basic information and leaderboards on a per-alert basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The new version of the website will also feature a complete redesign, as you can see by the very simple example that's shown below. I've learnt a lot about coding since I did PS2Alerts v4.0 back in October last year, so I think it's time to apply said knowledge.
