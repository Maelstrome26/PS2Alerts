                <p>
                    I've gone and consolidated all the project status "cards" into one place, rather than being randomly scattered across the site. There's now a new page called <a href="project-status" class="ga-event" ga-campaign="Homepage Announcement" ga-action="Project Status">Project Status</a> which allows you to see the whole project in it's entirity and it's current state. Check it out below!

                    <b>Victory Timeline</b> - One of the big parts that was missing from the homepage (the page you're viewing right now - scroll down!) was the Victory Timeline. This handy graph shows the victories for each faction over time, allowing you to see the trends that are occuring. This graph will be improved over time, with labels detailing when major patches landed so you can see their affect on alerts coming soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Continent Victories</b> - This panel shows you the breakdown of empire victories based on a per-continent and per-server basis, allowing you to see which server is dominant on particular continents.
