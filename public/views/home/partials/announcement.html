                        This handy graph shows the victories for each faction over time, allowing you to see the trends that are occuring. This graph will be improved over time, with labels detailing when major patches landed so you can see their affect on alerts coming soon.

                        There's now <b><u>4</u></b> new statistics panels which show you how each server's victories are distributed. E.g. You're now able to see which servers the Vanu Soverignity are doing best on Indar. (As of writing, that's Miller and Cobalt!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Global Server Victories</b> - Victories broken down by each server, showing how each faction are doing on each server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Global Continent Victories</b> - Victories broken down by continent, showing which faction is dominating Indar! (As of writing, that's the TR!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Per-Server Continental Victories</b> - Victories broken down by Server and by Continent, which allows you see how each continent fairs for each faction on each server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Faction Victory Contributions</b> - Shows a breakdown of the total number of wins, per faction, and how they contribute to the overall faction percentages. Shown in both a segmented bar chart and in tabular form. Interested to see which servers are pulling their weight? Now you can find out!

                        I've gone and consolidated all the project status "cards" into one place, rather than being randomly scattered across the site. There's now a new page called <a href="project-status" class="ga-event" ga-campaign="Homepage Announcement" ga-action="Project Status">Project Status</a> which allows you to see the whole project in it's entirity and it's current state. Check it out below!
