                    I'm happy to announce the new Leaderboard system! While in it's initial version, you'll be able to see the top 100 players, outfits and weapons by various metrics. See who are the top farmers, teamkillers, suiciders and crops, by all servers or by single servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This version is the start of something quite big in PS2. The website will soon&trade; have competitive ladders, which will pit you against other players of your server, and globally, and give you a ranking. More on this soon.
