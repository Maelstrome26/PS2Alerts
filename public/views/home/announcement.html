It is currently under reconstruction and redesign.

                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        The initial implementations of the <a href="alert-history">Alert History</a> and <a href="alert/19999">Alert Detail</a> pages have been launched! The Alert History page allows you to see all alerts in the past 48 hours (a temperary measure until a better date selection system can be made) and you're also able to see basic information and leaderboards on a per-alert basis.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="row row-no-margin" id="announcement-more">
                    <hr />
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The new version of the website will also feature a complete redesign, as you can see by the very simple example that's shown below. I've learnt a lot about coding since I did PS2Alerts v4.0 back in October last year, so I think it's time to apply said knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In bringing the webserver back online (in a clustered based setup) I decided it was prudent that I install PHP7, the latest and greatest in server side scripting, which makes any PHP site at least twice as quick.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately this meant, that due to the method of coding I was using for the old PS2Alerts website, that it would no longer function and was not compatible. This meant that the website was left crippled until I could have the time to fix it.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        However, <b>the collection script has still been running</b>, at least when I brought that particular server back. This means while I rewrite the website, that the statistics will still be collected in the background.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        So here we are. A new version of PS2Alerts is in the making. Rather than having a dead website, I decided that having a very basic version of the upcoming site would be prudent.
